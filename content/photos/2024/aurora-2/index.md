Another night out trying to get some shots of the Perseid shower and the aurora, unfortunately this was less successful than the [previous trip this year]({{< ref "photos/2024/aurora/index" >}}). On the whole it was a rather nice night out, and we did manage to capture another phenomena happening that night.
